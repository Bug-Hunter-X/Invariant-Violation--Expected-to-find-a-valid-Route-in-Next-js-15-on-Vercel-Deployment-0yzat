# Invariant Violation: Expected to find a valid Route in Next.js 15 on Vercel Deployment

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when deploying a seemingly simple Next.js 15 application to Vercel. The application works correctly locally but throws an `Invariant Violation: Expected to find a valid Route` error in the Vercel environment.  The error message suggests the absence of `useSearchParams` or `usePathname` from `next/navigation`, but the application doesn't require client-side routing.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (the application should run without errors).
4. Deploy to Vercel (the deployment will fail with the error).

## Solution

The solution is provided in `index.solution.js`, the issue was not directly related to a missing hook, but to an unintended interaction with other configurations.  For the exact nature of how to resolve this, please refer to the solution file which has a full explanation.
